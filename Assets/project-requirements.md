# CS2053 Project Requirements

## Setting up the Project on GitHub

Please read everything first and click the invitation link afterwards.
 	
- Only one team member needs to click the link per project team
  - You can choose whether you actually use GitHub to collaborate with your team?
  - The team member who accepts the invitation can invite the other team members to the GitHub project (optional)
			
- Go to your project repo on the GitHub website
  - Click on Settings -> Manage Access -> Invite teams or people
  - Enter the GitHub usernames for each of your teammates
  - Make sure you give them the appropriate rights on the repo 
  - They should now have access to the project and can clone and push to the repo
- Regardless of whether you use GitHub for your project: You will submit your project using this link
	If using GitHub to collaborate be careful! Make sure you keep your project in sync and understnad branching if you do 
	
	
- Keeping your [local repo in sync](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/keeping-your-local-repository-in-sync-with-github)
- Making [changes in branches](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch)

## Project Report

Remember to download the project report template and fill it out. This can be added to your GitHub project and pushed to GitHub when your project is complete. The template can be found on Teams under CS 2053 -> General -> Files -> Project.

## Project Presentation Video

You will create a project presentation video. You can find details for this, including the due date on D2L. Where you will find a Dropbox for your video file upload.

## Requirements

The course project focuses on game design and game programming. The following requirements must be adhered to, unless you have permission from the instructor.

Your game should be created independently and not be based upon a tutorial. While you are welcome to follow tutorials to help you learn new functionality you would like to add, your game should not contain the results or output from a tutorial.

 1. The project is team-based (teams can have 1-4 people). 
    + The game to be developed is a multi-level/scene game with 2N scenes/levels (where N is the number of teammates).
        
 2. The result of the project must be a complete, playable game with 2 or more levels or scenes, not including the start and end screens.

 3. The game should have a start (to introduce the game and authors) and end screen (for winning and/or losing). 
 
 4. The project and resulting game must include  storytelling with audio or (on screen) text narration. This doesn't have to be a prominent part of the game, but should be represented somehow.
 
 5. The project and resulting game must include the following game programming technologies: 2D graphics (with animations) or 3D graphics, sound, physics, dynamic (or multiple) cameras, AI, and user interface (menu). 
    + For AI, you will create some game objects that have state-based behaviour and involve pathfinding.
    + For the AI requirement you can use those provided by the game engine/platform which you will use for the project development and/or write your own.
    + Don't worry too much about this for now, until we have covered it in class

 6. The project should be developed using Unity. You can optionally use another game engine whose underlying game programing language should be a full programming language. If you plan to use a game engine other than Unity, please get approval from the course instructor.
   
 7. Your game should be able to run successfully within the game editor and in a 16by9 aspect ratio. 
   
 8. You can optionally have your game be designed for an X-Box style computer gamepad, but please make sure that every member of the team has one.
